The real beauty of the White House,? Trump earlier said.Meanwhile, taking aim at the US President, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, who spent most of her teen years as a White House resident spoke out in support of the White House staff, thanking the ?ushers, butlers, maids, chefs, florists,? etc, for all the hard work they do.Representative Dina Titus, a Democrat, also urged Trump to take his family and move out of the White House if he was unhappy with conditions.Trump spent a good deal of time away from the White House, including 21 of his first 26 weekends, according to CNN count, mostly at his luxury Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\"\"\""
